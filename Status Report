#### What have you done for your project so far?

I am primarily finsihed


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I just want to add some extra details like extra events, and figure out a way to make a working healthbar.


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had an issue with how to randomize the events that would occur on your journey. But I fixed it up and it runs perfectly now.
