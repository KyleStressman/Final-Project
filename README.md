Final-Project: Galactic Explorer

Main Idea:

The main idea around this game is that it is a spinoff of the famous game Oregon Trail but instead takes place in space.
You are given the option to travel to the 8 planets within our solar system. During your travel to the eight different planets
you are approached with different obstacles and you have choices on what you would/should do for each of them. If you choose
the wrong choice or action its game over and you have to start over...

Difficulties:

I had a few difficulties while writing the code for this game. It took me a long time to figure out how to code and seperate the
different actions with the corresponding outcomes because it kept only printing the first outcome no matter what number you put
in. It still seems to happen in the ourput but not as much as before. I also had difficulties with my mentality, just due to the fact 
that its not as advanced or complete as I wanted it to be. I struggled with the fact that it is not fully "complete" as I was hoping for 
when we first were introduced to the project itself.

Things I've Learned:

Throughout the coding process it really helped me become fully comfortable with loops because loops were very confusing to me going into this
project. I've also learned that there is always room for improvement. An example being that i did not like the state of my code during the
beginning stages of the project just for how many outcomes I had made. But as time went on I kept thinking of new scenarios and outcomes which 
added some depth to my code, and now I am very pleased with how it came out.

The Things I Enjoyed:

What I liked about the final project is the fact that we had free reign to make up anything our mind thought of. I liked the freedom because
we weren't forced to be focused on one topic. I also enjoyed making my code, because it gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted. Although
my code is not as complete or advanced as I would like to to be, I enjoyed creating something that I invisioned and making it become an reality.
